# FastText Word Embeddings in Aja Language: Semantic Analysis and Insights

## Abstract
This study presents the inaugural application of FastText word embeddings to the Aja language, aimed at uncovering semantic relationships in this underrepresented linguistic area. We developed FastText embeddings and evaluated them using WordSimilarity-353 comparisons, distance visualization between lexical pairs like 'eshi' (water) and 'ezo' (fire), and nearest-neighbor analysis for key terms such as 'Aja'. Our findings highlight the modelâ€™s proficiency and limitations in semantic interpretation, indicating promising avenues for leveraging FastText in less-represented languages, and pointing to the necessity of dataset expansion. This work contributes significantly to natural language processing research and emphasizes the importance of linguistic diversity in AI.

## Acknowledgments
We extend our heartfelt thanks to The Neukom Institute at Dartmouth for their generous funding and support of this research endeavor. Special gratitude is owed to Professor Laura McPherson, Associate Professor in the Linguistics program at Dartmouth College. Her expertise in phonology, morphology, and fieldwork, particularly in African languages, was invaluable in guiding this project.

Our sincere appreciation also goes to Professor Rolando Coto-Solano, a computational linguist, whose robust background in computational linguistics provided critical guidance in the computational aspects of this research. Their combined insights and mentorship have been instrumental in the successful completion of this project.

## Additionnal Information
The notebook contains code, analyses, and visualizations pertaining to the application of FastText word embeddings to the Aja language. The aim is to explore semantic relationships in this underrepresented linguistic area and contribute to the field of natural language processing.
